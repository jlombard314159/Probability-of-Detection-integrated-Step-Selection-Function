Description: This package estimates the probability of detection integrated sep selection function (PDiSSF) 
  presented in Vales et al. (2022), which was originally presented as the "RSF for GPS fix success" 
  in Nielson et al. (2009). Go to ___url_to_github where we will have access or links to thes articles,
